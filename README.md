# TextileTrust

## Project Description

TextileTrust is a blockchain-based supply chain transparency system specifically designed for the textile industry. This smart contract solution enables manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers to create an immutable record of textile products as they move through the supply chain. By leveraging blockchain technology, TextileTrust ensures authenticity, traceability, and transparency in textile production and distribution.

The platform addresses critical issues in the textile industry including counterfeiting, labor exploitation, environmental concerns, and lack of supply chain visibility. Consumers can verify the authenticity and ethical sourcing of their textile purchases, while businesses can demonstrate their commitment to sustainable and ethical practices.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the textile industry by creating a transparent, trustworthy, and sustainable supply chain ecosystem. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Counterfeiting**: Provide immutable proof of authenticity for textile products
- **Promote Ethical Practices**: Enable verification of fair labor and sustainable production methods
- **Empower Consumers**: Give buyers the power to make informed decisions about their purchases
- **Build Trust**: Create a transparent platform where all stakeholders can verify claims and certifications
- **Support Sustainability**: Track environmental impact and promote eco-friendly practices throughout the supply chain

   - Register new textile products with detailed metadata
   - Include material type, origin, certifications, and pricing information
   - Automatic assignment of unique product IDs
   - Initial supply chain step creation

2. **Product Transfer (`transferProduct`)**
   - Secure transfer of product ownership between authorized participants
   - Comprehensive tracking of location and actions
   - Immutable supply chain history creation
   - Role-based access control

3. **Product Verification (`verifyProduct`)**
   - Complete authenticity verification system
   - Access to full supply chain history
   - Real-time product status and ownership information
   - Certification and compliance tracking

### Additional Features

- **Participant Authorization**: Role-based access control system for manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers
- **Certification Tracking**: Support for multiple certifications (organic, fair-trade, sustainable, etc.)
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event system for transparency and auditing
- **Data Integrity**: Immutable record keeping with blockchain security
- **Multi-stakeholder Support**: Designed for complex supply chain ecosystems

### Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only authorized participants can interact with products
